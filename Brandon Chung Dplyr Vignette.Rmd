### Extended Tidyverse ggplot2 functions include: 
1. ()
2. Group_by()


## Sample Vignette of TidyVerse package: dplyr. Examples of the functions Mutate(), Select(), Filter(), and Summarise() 


To create this sample vignette I will use a csv file found on Kaggle at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data?select=Google.csv. The Kaggle webpage contains five csv files, one for each of the FAANG companies, but for this project I will focus on only the Google CSV. The data contains stock movement and volume information for each day from IPO day to 09/04/2020.   



```{r}
#Loading the Data
google_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chung-Brandon/FALL2024TIDYVERSE/refs/heads/main/Google.csv")
google_data
```

## Mutate()
```{r}
# The mutate() function adds a new variable that is a function of existing variables.

#Example 1

google_data <- google_data %>%
  mutate(day_change = (((Close - Open) / Open) * 100))

# Here we created a new variable called "day_change" by using Google's stock price on the open and the close. 
```

```{r}
head(google_data)
```
```{r}
#Example 2

google_data <- google_data %>%
  mutate(day_pchange.5 = abs(day_change) >5)
```
```{r}
head(google_data)
```

## Select() 
```{r}
# The select() function picks variables based on their names.

#Example 

google_data.select <- google_data %>%
  select(Date, Volume:day_pchange.5)

# Here we decided we only wanted to look at the variables Date, Volume, day_change, and day_pchange.5, so we used select to limit the data based on variables. Select returns all rows for the specified columns
```
```{r}
head(google_data.select)
```

## Filter()

```{r}
#The filter() function picks cases based on their values.

#Example

google_data.filter <- google_data %>%
  filter(day_pchange.5 == "TRUE")

# Here we decided we only wanted to look at the rows (cases) where the day_pchange.5 was "TRUE", so we used filter to limit the data based on the value day_pchange.5 being TRUE. Filter returns all columns for the specified cases.
```

```{r}
head(google_data.filter)
```


## Summarise ()
```{r}
#The summarise() function reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

#Example

google_data %>%
  group_by(day_pchange.5) %>%
  summarise(avg_volume = mean(Volume),
            count = n())

# Here we wanted to summarize our data by pulling out statistics of count and average volume. I first grouped the data by day_pchange.5 values (TRUE or FALSE), then the summarise function pulls the statistics for each group. Using group_by then summarise makes for easy statistic comparisons.
```

### ggplot2
```{r code for arrange dplyr package}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a simple scatter plot
ggplot(data = google_data, aes(x = Date, y = Volume)) +
  geom_point() 

# Create a scatter plot of date vs. volume
ggplot(google_data, aes(x = Date, y = Volume, state = factor(Open))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of Date vs. Volume",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Volume in Liters",
       state = "Open")




```



### Conclusion: The TidyVerse's Dplyr package is great at solving data manipulation challenages and for running statistical comparisons between groups of variable values.

Tidyverse dplyr contains more functions than the ones that are already highlighted. Their user is diverse when doing data manipulation and doing analysing of a dataset in order to identify patterns and make data useful in the business world.
